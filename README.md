Vishwa Ma'ali, commonly known as Mali, was a female Asian elephant who lived at Manila Zoo in Manila, Philippines. 
Born in Sri Lanka, she was given as a gift to First Lady Imelda Marcos by the Sri Lankan government in 1977 and lived at Manila Zoo from then on.
Species: Elephas maximus
Born: Vishwa Ma'ali; 1974â€“1980; Sri Lanka
Mali's condition was a subject of concern by various animal welfare groups and was commonly called the world's 'saddest' elephant.[5]

Mali was part of a campaign led by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) alleging the elephant was subject to neglect and was urging the release of the elephant. PETA campaigned for the move of Mali to an elephant sanctuary in Thailand, but there were concerns that the elephant might not be able to adapt to a new environment if moved out of the Manila Zoo. PETA alternatively had proposed that Mali be moved to the Elephant Sanctuary in the United States. The Network for Animals (NFA), which maintains a stance against zoos in general, made an exception for Mali. Despite its stance, the NFA expressed in 2018 that Manila Zoo was "the best option" in Mali's case.

There were also contrary reports which suggested Mali was healthy. In 2013, Mali underwent a checkup in a lead-up to a potential transfer to Thailand. Nikorn Thongtip of Kasetsart University remarked that Mali was "healthy in every system" although she exhibited "a little bit of obesity". Thongtip remarked that the elephant's nails "do not look bad, compared to elephants of the same age". Although Thongtip said that Mali had to be tested for tuberculosis, before she could be moved to Thailand. In 2018, results of blood tests conducted on Mali, suggested the elephant was healthy, although the animal was still remarked to be overweight and was on a diet plan.

On November 28, 2023, Manila mayor Honey Lacuna announced that Mali had died at around 3:45 p.m. that day. The following day, the necropsy result was announced. She died of congestive heart failure and had other health issues: nodules around her liver, a slightly inflamed kidney, a neoplastic pancreas, and a clogged aorta.

The Manila city government said it will preserve Mali's remains which would be displayed in a museum. It also considered requesting the Sri Lankan government a replacement elephant.
